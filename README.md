# Drone Jamming Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect drone jamming using machine learning techniques. It leverages classification models to distinguish between normal and jammed signals. It is inspired from the paper "Using OFDM based and Spectogram based approaches for Drone Jamming detections"


## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess and split the data.
3. Train the model using XGBoost or LightGBM.
4. Evaluate performance using classification metrics.

## Dependencies
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
